1		26th	May	1876		My old book is well filled, so that I will scribble in this one a little. I have made one trip to Buffalo before this, back to Cleveland with water lime, then to Huron light where I loaded corn, oats, wheat and a propeller wheel, the old Eclipse wheel that Ryan Johnson & Co. were anxious to get to Buffalo.	1	5
2		6th	August	1876		Arrived at Buffalo Friday noon. Took aboard 200 tons block marble at Frank William's Derrick, Blackwell's canal yesterday for Cleveland and sailed last evening. 	1	5
3	Buffalo, N.Y.	28th	September	1876		Arrived 8:30 P.M. Wind a gale from west northwest; a heavy sea rolling. Waves managed to climb onto the deck load when abreast of Point Abino and wash off perhaps 1,000 staves. 'Twas moonlight so I did not take a tug, but sailed in, saving $7.00 tow bill. On reaching the dock I found there was 2 feet of water in the schooner which must have got into the hatches. 'Twas the worst blow I have been out in for some time.	1	5
4		27th	July	1877		Stopped at Huron with the schooner 14 days. Finally loaded her with new wheat for Wickham for Buffalo, taking on 2,000 bushels in bags on deck. The load came from Norwalk over the Wheeling and Lake Erie R.R. – the first freight that came over the Road.	1	5
5	Huron, Ohio	3rd	November	1877		Arrived at Cleveland Monday eve, after a rough time. Sailed from there Tuesday eve for Huron. Thursday eve, paid off all hands and am now home for the winter.	1	5
6	Buffalo, N.Y.	6th	April	1878		Arrived this morning. Have been on the jump all day. We have unloaded, towed to salt docks, taken on 400 bbls. salt, then towing to Erie Basin cement dock, where took on 50 bbls. cement. Am ready to sail, but as the weather is not the best and I am tired out, shall hang on until morning.	1	5
7		28th	August	1876		Unloaded at Huron and took on wheat for Cleveland. Orris played the baby again and quit sailing again, leaving me at Huron.  Rather glad that Orris quit. Left Cleveland this evening with 334 tons soft coal for James Bennett on Mackinac Island.	1	4
8	Huron, Ohio	22nd	October	1876		Am stripping the schooner today. 'Tis early to tie up for the winter, but the freights are too low to pay the risk this time of the year, and by canceling the insurance, we get 20% rebate. Thank God, I have steered clear of accident the past summer and home again for the winter. The vessel has barely paid expenses, but many have not done that.	1	4
9	Huron, Ohio	12th	March	1877		The town is somewhat excited in regard to a railroad now building from Milan to Wheeling, Virginia. They will make Huron a terminus of the road, providing Huron raises $15,000 by the first of April. The schooner La Petite is the first and only schooner so far to sail or hail from Huron that is wind rigged.	1	4
10	Cleveland, Ohio	12th	June	1877		Left Huron at 12 o'clock last night, arriving here early this morning. I came in hopes of securing a load for Detroit or there about, but found it very dull here – no show for anything!  Mr. McDowell came aboard to see me, saying he had just got a letter requesting him to send him another load of coal by schooner La Petite. So I am all OK again.	1	4
11	Welland, Ontario	11th	May	1878		I am having lots of trouble here. The man, J.H. Hendershot, I was consigned to, is a bankrupt, owing everybody and paying nothing. I demanded my freight yesterday; he would not pay; stopped the unloading. I finally, this afternoon, sold a Mr. Symes 100 tons of coal, he to pay me my charges. It keeps me here over Sunday.	1	4
12	Welland, Ontario	18th	May	1878		Have finally got to work again. Shall have to tow down the canal two miles and leave 100 tons for my charges. I have written an article for the Buffalo papers, giving Hendershot a rub.	1	4
13		8th	July	1876		Have had a light head wind all of the time since leaving Buffalo. Little Edna's very happy and busy, first washing her doll clothes, then swinging. I made a swing for her under the main boom. She enjoys her trip very much. Cora's photograph, taken when she was two years old, is tacked inside of my writing desk – also her Mother's and Anna's.	1	3
14		15th	July	1876		Henry Snow and wife and children were aboard while I was at Cleveland Monday to supper with me. He has nothing to do yet and I fear they are very hard up.	1	3
15	Buffalo, N.Y.	15th	May	1877		Arrived Sunday morning. Took dinner with Courters. Went with Gund Williams and Frank Courter for a drive after dinner. I got a letter from daughter Anna yesterday. I also got a letter today written by my dear wife.	1	3
16		15th	June	1877		I got half doz. qts. of strawberries at 5 cents per qt. just before sailing yesterday. Had strawberry shortcake last night and tonight. I have a good woman cooking for me. The children all like her; she also likes the children, so they get along nicely.	1	3
17		21st	September	1877		Today, the 21st. I was 42 years old; 'tis my birthday!	1	3
18	Toledo, Ohio	30th	June	1878		The past two days have been very warm.  Edna and I have spent the day there, reading, singing, and part of the time, she has been combing my hair. She is happy, brown as a berry. She is a few days past 8 years old.	1	3
19		4th	July	1878		There has been a great change in the weather. At 10 o'clock, it cleared off, the sun came out and it has been a beautiful day. I wonder how they have enjoyed it at home. Anna was to be one of the waiters at the tables at the lawn fete, to be held on the square in front of the church at Huron. Edna is happy; she has been firing a toy pistol I got for her at Toledo.	1	3
20		26th	May	1876		Dear little Pet, Cora! It seems as if she was right with me today. How much we miss her! Why could she not be left with us? Four weeks today she was taken sick; called the doctor the night before, but none of us thought 'twas anything serious. But it proved to be membranous croup. She died Monday morning, 3 o'clock May 1st.	1	2
21		6th	June	1876		I went home Friday on the 3:30 P.M. train. Came back to Cleveland Monday morning. My daughter, Anna, came with me and is now aboard the vessel enjoying herself. She now sits near me reading by the lamp in my room. I miss little Cora so much at home. “Papa's big girl,” as she said.	1	2
22	Lake Erie	22nd	June	1876		I bought Edna a napkin ring at Buffalo, also some warp for a rag carpet, and a head stone for Cora's grave. 'Tis the last I can do for the little darling.	1	2
23	Huron, Ohio	9th	May	1877		Arrived here Sunday morning. The wind has been blowing a gale from northeast for three days...We have a boy baby, born at 10:30 last night. Mother and child doing nicely. Edna is much pleased with the baby. Anna don't seem to like it much.	1	2
24	Buffalo, N.Y.	28th	August	1877		When in Cleveland last week on way to Huron, I bought an easy chair in hair cloth for my wife, price $11.00. Yesterday I bought half dozen handsome walnut chairs for the dining room.	1	2
25	Sandusky, Ohio	1st	May	1878		Went home last evening; returned this morning. Found all well there. Baby Austin had not forgotten me, but laughed as soon as he saw me and insisted on my holding him all of the time I was in the house. I have no load yet. There does not seem to be anything for one to do just now but wait for something to turn up.	1	2
26	Huron, Ohio	22nd	May	1878		Arrived 4 P.M. Saturday. Baby Austin is growing finely. Anna is getting along nicely with her music lessons. Edna is digging away at school. Little wife is not feeling very well, but I hope she will soon be better. Everything to thank God for!	1	2
27	Buffalo, N.Y.	11th	October	1877		The wind yesterday freshened to a gale and was blowing very hard. Many vessels run back. I arrived here 9:30 P.M. – 25 hours from Huron. A tug met me at the breakwater. She took my tow line and broke it, letting me strike a tow barge, breaking off my jib boom, both davits and smashing boat! Many vessels came in with spars and sails gone.	1	1
28		12th	October	1877		I hauled to dry dock last evening. We have taken the forecastle out and the ceiling under the cabin. I don't find as much rotten timber as expected, but there is enough of it.	1	1
29		20th	October	1877		It rained all day yesterday and up to noon today, but the carpenters worked all of the time. We will have the planking in forward by Monday night; then will step new foremast, rig out new jib boom and set the rigging up. I hope to be ready to load if I can secure any up freight by Thursday.	1	1
30		22nd	October	1877		The carpenter got through the work tonight.  They have done a good job and done it quick – 9 days work that would have taken two months at Huron during the winter. I shall keep two or three aboard tomorrow to get forecastle in place. Am promised 200 tons of block marble from Frank Williams for Cleveland. Got a letter from wife this morning. She writes that all are well at home. Thank God!	1	1
31				Date Unknown		I believe it is easy enough to get along on any vessel as soon as the officers and men find you are willing to do your very best. From what the sailors tell me, I am with the best crew on the Lakes. 	2	5
32		1st	February			I hear the mate coming and shall hear “all hands on deck,” “hurry down there” & "go aloft to scrape the main mast." We shall get into Lake Huron soon and then have some hard times. There are three vessels being towed by our tug, going to Saginaw for Lumber. It is clouding over like rain and I am poorly prepared for cold or wet.	2	5
33		17th	June			Was the hardest day out. It commenced at 3 o'clock in the morning with a heavy storm and continued all day. I was soaked through over and over again by the water coming in over the bulwarks. I went aloft to help furl the main gaff top – got awfully seasick and passed a most uncomfortable day and night. I did not get to bed till 4 this morning. I slept with wet clothes and wet boots – 3 hours. It's an awful looking place on the top of the mast in a storm – railing and pitching and somewhat necessary to hold on.	2	5
34		19th	June			This afternoon I steered for six consecutive hours while all the other sailors were shortening the shrouds. There are a great many sails in sight and the lake steamers to and from Chicago. We expect to be there tomorrow morning.	2	5
35		27th	June			I went up to the mast head to help furl the gaff sail in perfect darkness. In the morning at 4 o'clock it rained very hard – the mate gave me the Captain's oil coat and I took off my boots and rolled up my pants and came out at the end of my four hours quite dry. 	2	5
36	Buffalo	8th	July			Sailors are a hard class of men. They have no home in the summer except on the Lake. 	2	5
37				Date Unknown		For all the pleasures of sailing I think I shall not want to go to sea again immediately.  Regular & unbroken rest is what I feel the want of most. This vessel is worse than others in that respect.	2	5
38				Date Unknown		My hands have grown so hard & large pulling at the ropes that I had to take off Mrs. Perkin’s ring. My face & nose are all sun burned and sore.	2	5
39		9th	June			A beautiful morning. Went down to the dock to see the Captain of the Anne Henry. He is a fine man or I am no judge. I can go aboard tomorrow if I please. I think I should take one trip as I am out of money. Have concluded to go into the real estate and employment agency business when I come back.	2	4
40				Date Unknown		The Captain’s a very nice man till he has head winds or bad luck and then grumbles & swears some.	2	4
41		20th	June			After rather a poor days sailing we got into Chicago about 4 o'clock and were towed in the dirtiest river water I ever smelled. There are crowds of vessels here and many of them lying idle, some have not been out this season. Grain is only 3 cents a bushel to Buffalo.	2	4
42		21st	June			I was paid off this morning and got five dollars for my trip. I can stay on board and get my meals but no pay while she is in port. If the Captain does not get a load and lays up I shall be in a tight place with not enough to get back to Cleveland. Today we had an extra good dinner of Roast beef, peas, turnips, pie, pudding.	2	4
43		22nd	June			There are lots of men here idle & trying to work for their board, even the 1st mate would work for his board if he don’t get another situation. I have money enough to go back to Cleveland by rail, but should be there idle till the first July spending money. While if I stay aboard the vessel I get my board and if she goes down the Lakes I get my passage & save and make a little more.	2	4
44		7th	July			Walked out this afternoon around the streets. Quite a busy place, the Erie Canal and NY Central Railroad, make business together with the lumber and shipping. I expect to get paid off tomorrow and leave for Cleveland. If I get money enough I shall buy a new pair of pants and vest if not, go without. I weighed 157 without a coat or underclothes.	2	4
45				Date Unknown		I think I am growing fat and I know I am improved in health. I eat more at a meal than I used to eat in a day. The cook is a good one in her profession, but very silly.	2	3
46		11th	June			The sails were made and a heavy storm came on. I got wet through having no rubber clothing. I had to stay up on watch till 4 the next morning. At 4, I went to my bunk chilly and tired and laid awake half an hour before I got warm enough to sleep. 40 minutes after we were called up for a tug as we were nearly to the entrance to the Detroit River.	2	3
47		14th	June			Had a big squall this morning which laid the schooner on her beam ends and brought water on the deck in abundance. We are in Saginaw Bay out of sight of land. I have to go aloft now to hand off the loft gaff topsails and do almost everything a sailor has to do. We are now about 125 miles from the river, we have lunch of cold meat, bread and butter and cake every night at 12.	2	3
48		28th	June			We were up all night in a storm and heavy wind. We got to the dock load off “shore lumber” which is the hardest kind of work. Heavy green pine boards and planks; finished work at 6:30 and got to bed a little after 8 having been at hard labor without sleep for 36 hours and only 2 in the last 48.	2	3
49		1st	July			Went swimming in the evening. The mosquitoes beat anything we read about. I shall never doubt a western mosquito story again. I went to sleep last night with a swarm of them about my face & singing in my ears. The more I fought them, the thicker they got and I was so tired I gave up at last and my face was spotted this morning like the measles. While I am writing I stop every line and kill a dozen.	2	3
50		2nd	July			Shoved lumber again till nearly six o'clock and then got the vessel ready for a sailing. Am not sorry to get away from this place of hard work, hot sultry weather and mosquitoes.	2	3
51		4th	July			The only sign of 4th of July to us was in hauling up the colors of red white and blue. Passed through Lake St Clair at noon and lay opposite Detroit till about dark and got underway again for Lake Erie. Saw the fireworks in Detroit while going down the river.	2	3
52		16th				I have been aloft, to shift the gaff topsail four times today. Thought what Lipsie would say if she could see me up 85 feet out in the ropes.	2	2
53		30th				I washed my clothes and am going bathing for my own benefit this afternoon. Went in swimming at 4 o'clock in the lake and had a good wash - feel much better for it. We have only 2 meals on Sunday when in port - Dinner at 1/2 past 3. Read the psalms for the day and wrote to Lipsie and looked at her photo.	2	2
54		8th				It seemed like starting for home and I am afraid I can't stay when I get to Cleveland. Liked the music onboard and I never heard music from an accordion before tonight!	2	2
55		9th				Got to Cleveland at 11 o'clock, put right straight for the P.O after leaving my luggage at the hotel and two letters from my dear Lipsie. How my heart thumped at the sight of them! If my little wife knew the joy I felt at getting her dear sweet letters she wouldn’t think that her Davy was a scamp & did not love her. I am sure no two ever loved as we do. I must go home to see her.	2	2
56				Date Unknown		Mr. Benedict was glad to see me back & I bought a hat. I lost mine over board on the schooner in a gale. This afternoon I shall get a bath & hair cut & look as much like a civilized person as possible.	2	2
57		21st	June			A very pleasant occupation is making sail or raising the main and fore sail, going to the mast head & holding on. The halyards the weight of 3 or 4 men at a time pulling the sails up as follows.	2	1
58		22nd	June			The Captain is taken sick this evening down the river about a mile and a boat has come after him.	2	1
59		27th	June			A steam tug is a small vessel with big engine made to draw heavy loads rather than carrying them.
A scow is a schooner boat with square bow and stern, like a flat boat.
A barge is a vessel without sails or spars though some have engine and are steam barges.
A canal boat is a ship made expressly to travel the canals.
A bark has three masts the first square rigger and the other schooner rigged.
A 3 + after is a three masted schooner A fore + after is a schooner, a brig is a schooner with square rigged foremast 	2	1
60		5th	July			Hardly any sleep today, weather squally and all hands on deck till towards evening when it cleared up.	2	1
61		6th	July			Very squally night, heavy rain and wind all the time and big sea. About 5 o'clock a gale commenced and blowed all day, happily a fair wind and skimmed over the water like a bird, the biggest sea I ever saw or want to see. No vessels ...to bed at two after hard work enough for anyone.	2	1
